## Overview

Cuik.io is a high-performance platform designed for real-time data processing and seamless API integrations. Built with a focus on scalability and efficiency, it leverages modern technologies to handle complex data workflows.

## Key Features

- **Scalable Backend Infrastructure**: Engineered a robust backend using FastAPI that handles real-time data processing and multiple API integrations simultaneously.
- **High-Performance Algorithms**: Implemented critical system components in Rust for optimal performance and memory efficiency.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Designed a distributed system using microservices to ensure scalability and maintainability.
- **Real-time Processing**: Built real-time data pipelines capable of processing thousands of events per second with minimal latency.

## Technologies Used

- **FastAPI**: For building high-performance REST APIs with automatic documentation
- **Rust**: For performance-critical components and system-level optimizations
- **Next.js**: For the modern, responsive frontend interface
- **PostgreSQL**: For reliable data persistence
- **Redis**: For caching and real-time data streams
- **Docker & Kubernetes**: For containerization and orchestration
